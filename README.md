## xkcd Password Strength

* Inspired from [xkcd #936](https://xkcd.com/936/)
* [Download words.csv](https://github.com/pkLazer/password_rank/blob/master/4000-most-common-english-words-csv.csv)

#### Prompt

```
I need a python script that does the following:

- Reads a list of words from a CSV file
- Randomly chooses 4 words from the list to generate a password
- Prints each word to the console with a random color for visual effect
- Copies the generated password to the user's clipboard
- Prints a message confirming the password was copied
```

#### Output
```
> python3 random-password-xkcd.py
awayhimselfcoursehouse
Password copied to clipboard!
```
